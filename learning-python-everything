# Learning Python Programming

# Printing something

    print("Hello World") # here print() is an inbuilt function

# Use of variables

    age = 43 # this assign the value 43 to the variable named age
    print(age) # will display 43

# Use of multiple variables with values

    Method 01:    

    sarah, bob, mike = 16, 21, 17 # assigns different values to different variables

    print(mike) # will output the value 17

    Method 02:

    sarah = bob = mike = 17 # assign same value to different variables

    print(bob) # will display the value 17

    print(sarah) # will display the value 17

# Use of arithmetic operators

    val1 = 15
    val2 = 20

    val1 + val2 # this will output the value 35. Where addition is performed.

    val1 - val2 # this will give us -5 as the output. Subtraction is done.

    val1 * val2 # this will give us 300 as the output. Multiplication is done.

    val1 / val2 # this will give us 0, normal division is performed.

    val1 % val2 # this will give us 15, Modulus (remainder value) is done.
