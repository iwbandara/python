# Introduction to Lists in Python

# A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ] .

    shopList = ["Oranges", "Apples", "Bananas", "Cheese"] # defining the List

    shopList = ["Oranges", "Apples", "Bananas", "Cheese"]
                    0           1       2           3       # Index values
                    1           2       3           4       # Element number

# To extract elements from a List, you need to use the index values mentioned inside [].

    shopList[0] # will output 'Oranges', which has the index value of 0.

    shopList[3] # will output 'Cheese', which has the index value of 3.

    shopList[0:2] # will output '['Oranges', 'Apples']'

    shopList[2:] # will output "['Bananas', 'Cheese']"

    shopList[-2:] # will output "['Bananas', 'Cheese']"

    shopList[:-2] # will output "['Oranges', 'Apples']"

# Adding new items to a List in Python

# Uses 'append' function

    shopList.append("Blueberries") # item 'Blueberries will be added to the end of the list.

# How to replace an existing item with a new value

    shopList[0] = "Cherry" # replace 'Oranges with Cherry'

# How to remove an item from the list

# Use 'del' keyword with item index value to delete or remove an item from a list

    del shopList[1] # removes the item 'Apples' from the list

    del shopList[1:] # removes the items 'Apples', 'Bananas', & 'Cheese' from the list
