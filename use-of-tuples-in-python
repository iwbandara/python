# Use of tuples in Python

# Just another data structure which is unmutables (data cannot be added or changed)

# Most of the other functions done with a list can be done with a tuple except changing.

    tuple1 = ("oranges", "bananas", "cherries")

    tuple1[2] # outputs "cherries"

    tuple1 * 2 # will output ('oranges', 'bananas', 'cherries', 'oranges', 'bananas', 'cherries')

    len(tuple1) # will output the count of the items in the tuple, which is 3.

    del tuple1 # will delete the entire tuple
